❓ This is the repository for a React Native port of my fullstack Journal App project, see here: https://github.com/kristianka/fullstack-project 

⚠️ This is mostly **proof-of-concept** and an experiment how fastly you can create a React Native app when you experience with React.


<h1>Info</h1>

- Navbar isn't displayed when user hasn't logged in
- Login forms have error handling and notify user
- You can navigate to the note's location by pressing the navigate icon.
- You can view your journals, profile and logout.


<h2>Main technologies used 🔧</h2>

All the code are made with TypeScript and with latest libraries and standards.

- Expo
- TypeScript
- React Native Paper
- React Query
- React Native Screens
- React Native Map Link
- React Native Toast Message
  
Backend is the same one as in the full web app.

<h2>Some screenshots</h2>

>⚠️Reminder that this is a proof-of-concept and not polished at all!
